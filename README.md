This is a demo app I've made up to learn new stuff. It will eventually probably do something useful but until then the goal is to play around with technologies.

Working now:
 - you can save employer and employee basic data in the basic data section (it is very rudimentary though)
 - you can do salary calculation with hard-coded data

Next:
 - make salary calculation use real, saved data
 - implement session handling
 - implement Google authentication

Later:
 - implement batch jobs (salary calculation processing)
