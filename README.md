This is a demo app I've made up to learn new stuff. It will eventually probably do something useful but until then the goal is to play around with technologies.

Working now:
 - you can save employer and employee basic data in the basic data section (it is very rudimentary though)
 - you can do salary calculation with the data
 - you need to login using Google authentication to use the app, the login page is ugly at the moment, maybe make a proper landing page in the future.

Next small steps:
 - make server.js prettier
 - implement logging

Next big steps:
 - make server and client use the same calculation code (first come up with a user story that needs calculation on the server side).
 - complete the basic data page

Later:
 - implement batch jobs (salary calculation processing)
